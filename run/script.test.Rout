  NAs are not allowed in subscripted assignments

checking model sizes and dimensions... This model is not fully initialized. This is not an error. To see which variables are not initialized, use model$initializeInfo(). For more information on model initialization, see help(modelInitialization).
model building finished.
Missing values (NAs) or non-finite values were found in model variables: nu_leaf_N, nu_leaf_Cab, nu_leaf_Car, nu_leaf_Cw, nu_leaf_Cm, reflectance, sd_leaf_N, sd_leaf_Cab, sd_leaf_Car, sd_leaf_Cw, sd_leaf_Cm. This is not an error, but some or all variables may need to be initialized for certain algorithms to operate properly. For more information on model initialization, see help(modelInitialization).
Monitored nodes are valid for WAIC.
